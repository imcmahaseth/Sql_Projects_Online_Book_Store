# ðŸ“š SQL Portfolio Project: Online Book Store Data Analysis

[![LinkedIn]((https://linkedin.com/in/mahaseth)

This project showcases the use of SQL to analyze the operations of an online bookstore. I designed a relational database and developed a set of SQL queries to simulate real-world scenarios. The aim of this analysis is to extract business-critical insights and demonstrate the ability to make data-driven decisions.

## ðŸ›  Technical Overview:

* *Database Schema:* A normalized schema was designed, comprising three main tables: Books, Customers, and Orders, reflecting the relationships between them. Data integrity was ensured by implementing Primary and Foreign Key Constraints.
* *SQL Queries:* Over 15 SQL queries were developed, including:
    * *Basic Queries:* Data selection, filtering, and sorting.
    * *Join Operations:* Utilizing INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, etc., to combine data from related tables.
    * *Aggregate Functions:* Employing COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MAX(), MIN() to analyze business trends.
    * *Grouping and Filtering:* Using GROUP BY and HAVING clauses to group and filter data based on specific criteria.
    * *Common Table Expressions (CTEs):* Utilizing CTEs to simplify complex queries and enhance readability.
    * *Subqueries:* Employing subqueries to solve more intricate questions.
* *Analytical Goals:* The queries were designed to answer the following business questions:
    * Identifying the top 5 best-selling books and their authors.
    * Determining the total revenue generated by different book genres.
    * Identifying the most valuable customers (e.g., highest spenders).
    * Identifying books frequently bought together or in bulk.
    * Identifying customers who have never purchased books from the Romance genre.
    * Calculating the remaining book stock after all processed orders.

## ðŸ’¾ Dataset:

The dataset used in this project includes the following files:

* Books.csv: Information about books (e.g., ISBN, title, author, genre, price, stock).
* Customers.csv: Information about customers (e.g., customer ID, name, email, address).
* Orders.csv: Information about orders (e.g., order ID, customer ID, book ISBN, order date, quantity).

## ðŸš€ Usage and Conclusions:

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to analyze real-world business data using SQL. The insights gained can be used to make informed decisions in areas such as inventory management, marketing strategies, and customer relationship management.
